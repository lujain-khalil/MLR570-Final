# MLR570 Final Exam Resources
This repository compiles resources that could be useful in preparations for the MLR 570 final exam.

## Notes 
These include written summaries of the lectures. Trying my best to catch anything mentioned in the recording but not the slides. There's also handwritten documents practicing any potential mathematical drivations/problems in the [Notes/Practice/](https://github.com/lujain-khalil/MLR570-Final/blob/main/Notes/Practice) directory.
